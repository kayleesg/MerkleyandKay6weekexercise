	<h1>Welcome to my little training plan!</h1>
	<p>Here, I hope to increse our skills as athletes!</p>
	<p>I wanted to do this training as a little experiment.</p>
	<p>The program is only 6 weeks long and starts April 29th. How it will work is there will be 3 days training, then 2 days rest, then 2 days training and 1 day rest.</p>
	<p>The reason behind this pattern is that it will hopefully maximize training and recovery days.</p>
	<p>For this experiment, I wanted to see how effective it was especially with weight loss.</p>
